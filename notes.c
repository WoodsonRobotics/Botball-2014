Need to add line following
and touch sensor

~SORTING~
	For now: sweeper motors run outwards when nothing is detected and when something is, it decides what to do with it.
	- must look at the moment when a pom gets in sight to adjust how long/fast the sweeper motor should run to put it out without releasing the next one.
	- might need to use <> because some of the same coloured poms might be next next to eachother in the track
	
	
	IDEA:what if the camera tracked the order of the poms as the went into the track?
	then only regulate how they come out at the end...?
	- then we'd need to just have the sweeper function going inwards until it    reaches the last pom
